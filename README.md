# szabo-f2py
The book "Modern Quantum Chemistry" by Szabo and Ostlund includes example Fortran code to perform a simple Hartree-Fock calcuation on HeH+.
The example code, [szabo.f](http://www.ccl.net/cca/software/SOURCES/FORTRAN/szabo/index.html), is available on ccl.net.  

The plan for this repository is to create an f2py wrapper for the example so that it can be called from python.
